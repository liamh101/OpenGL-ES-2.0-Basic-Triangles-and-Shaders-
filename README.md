# OpenGL-ES-2.0-Basic-Triangles-and-Shaders-
Start to grasp an understanding of OpenGL ES by buiding my own Android progam to build basic rotating triangels and shaders. 

This was built over a period of a week in my own time.

Used www.learnopengles.com (lesson 1) as a basis of my program, but built all from scratch and did not copy any of the code used in the program.
